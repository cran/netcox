Description: Efficient procedures for fitting and cross-validating the overlapping group Lasso (implemented in C++) for Cox models with time-dependent covariates. The penalty term is a weighted sum of infinity norms of (overlapping) groups of coefficients, which can select variables structurally with a specific grouping structure.
